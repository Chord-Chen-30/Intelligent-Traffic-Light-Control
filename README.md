# Intelligent-Traffic-Light-Control

  In modern society, traffic lights play an important rolein scheduling traffic flow in different directions. However, existing traffic light scheduling schemes often cause traffic jams especially during rush hour, for the reason that it only obeys a simple scheme of periodic alternating and usually cannot fit traffic conditions in real world. In this work, we design a new intelligent traffic lights schedule based on reinforcement learning and take humanization into consideration. This work shows great performance on three different
simulated traffic conditions which means we can beat the traditional traffic lights schedule.
